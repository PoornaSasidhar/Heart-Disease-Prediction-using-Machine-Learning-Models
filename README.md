## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using three fundamental machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is heart.csv. It contains various features related to heart health and disease indicators.

## Models

- **Logistic Regression**: Implements logistic regression to classify heart disease outcomes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Utilizes the KNN algorithm to make predictions based on the similarity of data points.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Implements SVM for heart disease classification by finding optimal hyperplanes.

## Results

- Present the performance metrics and accuracy for each model.
- Visualize results using graphs and charts.
- Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the models in predicting heart disease.
